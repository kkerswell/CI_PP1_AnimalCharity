## Design

### Design Choices

The webpage was designed with the feeling a customer might get while dining at the restaurant. It is calm, warm and inviting. Some of the imagery on the page has a round shape with a border to resemble food served on a plate.
   
### Colour Scheme
- Create a modern colour scheme with soft tones
- Primary background of the website will be white, so this would need to form part of the palette.
- The goal is to choose gender-neutral colours.
- Final palette colours that were chosen were #F4F9F4 #C4E3CB #8AAE92 #616161
- Source: https://colorhunt.co/palette/f4f9f4c4e3cb8aae92616161

### Fonts
- Create a modern look with soft lines
- Final font chosen was Montserrat Alternates by Google Fonts
- Source: https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat+Alternates?query=Montserrat+Alternates

### Images and Video
- If the site was live then the companies own images/video would be used
- For the project, royalt free imagry is required
- Include pictures of cats and dogs
- sources (images): https://unsplash.com/
- Sources (video): https://www.pexels.com/

### Structure
The page is structured in a well know, recognisable, user friendly, and easy to learn way. 
    
Upon arriving to the website the user sees a familiar type of navigation bar and footer bar. 
    
The website consists of five separate pages: 
- A homepage with a sections for News and Sunday Meal Offers
- An about page with the About Us and Meet the Chef
- A menu page
- A image gallery with images and video showcasing the general feel of the restaurant
- A contact page with a contact form, a map and information about the bussines section

## Development 

### Building and Maintaining

GitHub was used as version control software to maintain, upload and share code with other developers.

### Commits

I kept track of updates by using commits in Git.  The terminal commands for these were:

* git add .
* git commit -m "Description of change"
* git push

### Deployment

To complete this action I completed the following process:

1. Navigated to my site repository

    https://github.com/kkerswell/CI_PP1_AnimalCharity

2. Clicked on "Settings" within the top navigation area

### Accessibility

https://wave.webaim.org/ was used to test accessibility.

The results were as follows:

1. Errors
    * 3 x Errors for broken links. However, these were for the three social links in the footer and is currently expected behaviour.
2. Contrast Errors
    * Where I had grey text on a green background, I had warnings for low contrast. However, I felt the colours worked well and decided to keep them.
3. Alerts
    * 1 x Alert for HTML5 video or audio. However, this was only for video with audio and the site recommended providing synchronized captioning and a transcript, the video I used did not have any audio included.

### Performance

## Problems

* spacing the a links in the nav bar.  I originally tried to add margin and padding but this was having an undesired effect.  I got arround this by adding line-height to the nav a section.
* When Adding a h1 to the header, the alignment of both h1 and nav changed to an undesired style. I struggled to get the h1 to align left and the nav to align right.  I then changed both to display inline but the nav was then aligned right next to the h1 on the right side of the page, when I wanted it on the left. I overcame this by adding float right to the nav.
* When hosting page on GitHub pages, the site did not work correctly.  I had to change all file paths to relative in order for this to work.
* On the index page, I wanted a large full-scale image to cover the screen with a text overlay.  Whilst I managed to achieve this, I found I experienced issues when it came to responsive design. I attempted several fixes but ultimately I decided to change the design of the page to allow for easier coding and responsiveness.
* When trying to style the images in the animal_hero div on the About Us page, I had an issue where the cat image was being pushed off the side of the page. I had to utilise Bootstrap in order to get the styling I wanted for this.
