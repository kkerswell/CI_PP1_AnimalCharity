            <span class="about_text">
                Founded in 2021, Cymru Animal Shelter is a family run business which looks to help our cats and dogs
                find their loving, forever homes. We started our shelter as there were no other shelters which were
                local, so we thought the need existed to help local animals and local people have a convenient locations
                to meet and fall in love. We have quickly become known in the local area and we invite you to join our
                small family in any way you can.

                We keep the shelter going through money raised from charitable donations and our fundraiser events. We
                often have in excess of twenty cats and twenty dogs at any given time and they eat a lot! Also, we
                ensure all of our animals have regular check-ups with the vets, booster shots and are all spayed. As you
                could imagine, the costs involved for this are also high. So, if you are in a position to help in any
                way then please get in touch with us via our social media pages. We also post all of our annual and
                upcoming fundraising events on our fundraising page, so feel free to check that out too for some awesome
                events.
