I then changed both to display inline but the nav was then aligned right next to the h1 on the right side of the page, when I wanted it on the left. I overcame this by adding float right to the nav.

### Accessibility

The results were as follows:

1. Errors
    * 3 x Errors for broken links. However, these were for the three social links in the footer and is currently expected behaviour.
2. Contrast Errors
    * Where I had grey text on a green background, I had warnings for low contrast. However, I felt the colours worked well and decided to keep them.
3. Alerts
    * 1 x Alert for HTML5 video or audio. However, this was only for video with audio and the site recommended providing synchronized captioning and a transcript, the video I used did not have any audio included.
